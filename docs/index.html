        <p>
          Follow @thelangbot that retweets all the tweets that contain the
          #100DaysOfLanguage and #langtwt hashtag. It’s a great way to keep
          yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Optionally,
          make sure to take notes in a physical journal to reinforce learning
          concepts. You can download and use 100DayLog.txt to track your
          progress if you'd like.

          Also, please encourage others who are posting their daily updates on
          their progress. Supporting others helps build and grow a community
          around positivity and that is helpful and effective. Plus, it's more
          likely that you will stick to your own commitment meeting new friends
          along the way!
